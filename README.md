✅ Exercise 1 – Student Enrollment System  

1. **Code Clarity**  
   - Added step-by-step comments (input, processing, output) for better readability  
   - Used descriptive variable names (`students`, `student_to_remove`)  

2. **Functionality**  
   - Implemented alphabetical sorting before displaying the student list  
   - Added validation when removing students to prevent errors for non-existent names  

3. **User Feedback**  
   - Displays the total student count using `len()` for transparency  

**Result**: A robust system that manages enrollments, sorts data, and handles removals safely.  

### ✅ Exercise 2 – City Coordinates & Latitude Analysis  
**Key Improvements:**  

1. **Data Structure**  
   - Used tuples to store immutable (latitude, longitude) pairs efficiently  

2. **Analysis**  
   - Printed labeled coordinates for each city  
   - Extracted and displayed latitudes separately to demonstrate tuple indexing  
   - Calculated mean latitude using a clean list comprehension  

**Result**: Optimized for readability and analytical clarity with tuples and list operations.  


### ✅ Exercise 3 – Student Score Analysis  
**Key Optimizations:**  

1. **Efficiency**  
   - Used list/generator expressions for faster processing  

2. **Filtering Logic**  
   - Selected students with averages ≥ 15 concisely  
   - Identified the highest individual score using `max()`  

3. **Condition Checks**  
   - Counted students with any score < 10 using `any()` for clean logic  

**Result**: Compact yet powerful performance analysis with minimal code.
